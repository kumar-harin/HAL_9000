HAL_9000 may not be the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework.

Workflow of this framework is inspired by Tensorflowâ€™s Keras.

As of now, HAL_9000 offers 7 different variants of NNs:

    -> Perceptron
    -> Multilayer Perceptron
    -> Dense Net
    -> Conv Net
    -> Vanilla RNN
    -> LSTM
    -> DQN
